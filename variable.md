## JAVASCRIPT DOCUMENTATION [VARIABLES]
- `var` : The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- `let` : The let declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- `const` : Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be re-declared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

## Variable Declarations
> To use variables in JavaScript, we first need to create it i.e. declare a variable. To declare variables, we use one of the var, let, or const keywords.
